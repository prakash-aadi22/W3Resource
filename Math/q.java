                From Wikipedia,
                In recreational mathematics and combinatorial design, a magic square is a n x n square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range 1, 2, ..., n2 such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. The sum is called the magic constant or magic sum of the magic square. A square grid with n cells on each side is said to have order n.
